About

><sub>The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear</sub>

<sup>
Slowly ditching and scrubbing my popular social media channels for a new skin. The name, StackMaster, is not about StackSats...A StackMaster is elected during the setup of a Redundant Stack Array of Cisco Switches. Once configured and booted, the Stack will elect a Master Switch. Through a series of power-cycles and configurations, one can foce the Election and Stack-Order so that the Master sits on top. I started this Git to help contribute to the $SCRT Network and their Python-Ops for DataAnalytics. However, when I'm not contributing to them, I will be working on InfoSec related categories.

Future Ops-Projects

><sub>Concepts, Ideas, and the overall direction I will be taking this Git</sub>
 - Overall I am looking to further my knowledge in security via various toolsets.
 - You are going to see some Bash scripts first off, followed by Python
 - I will eventually reconnect with my foundation in C++ and see what I can *brew* over there
